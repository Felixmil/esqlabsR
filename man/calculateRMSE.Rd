\usage{
calculateRMSE(dataMappingList)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataMappingList}{A \code{DataMapping} or a list of \code{DataMapping} objects.}
}
\value{
Total error for all groups across all provided data mappings.

\description{
Calculate the root mean square error for groupings in \code{dataMapping}s
}
\details{
The error is calculated for each group separately and added up. For each group, the error is defined as
the root of the sum of the squared residuals between each simulated result and observed data.
