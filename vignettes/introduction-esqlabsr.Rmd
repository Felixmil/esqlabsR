The **esqlabsR** R-package is designed to facilitate and standardize modeling and simulation (M&S) activities performed in the R environment. The main focus of the package lies on providing standard workflows for running simulations with the [Open Systems Pharmacology](http://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/) Software (OSPS) R package (ospsuite-r) and creating standardized figures.

## General information
This package builds up on the functionality of the ospsuite-r package. It is strongly recommended to get familiar with the [R-Introduction](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-r/r-introduction) section of the OSPS manual.

In order to load a simulation in R, it must be present in the **\*.pkml** file format. Every simulation in PK-Sim or MoBi can be exported to the *.pkml file. The examples shown in this documentation are based on the Aciclovir example model, until stated otherwise. The model can be found in the PK-Sim examples folder of the OSPS installation.

The documentation is divided into three parts covering the following aspects:

* [Facilitating M&S](modeling-simulation.html)
* [Data handling](data-handling.html)
* [Figure creation](figure-creation.html)
* [Helper methods](helper-methods.html)

## Object-oriented approach

The **esqlabsR** package utilizes the concept of object oriented (OO) programming based on the [R6 system](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html). While the philosophy of the package is to offer a functional programming workflow more common for the R users, it is important to understand some basic concepts of the OO programming. Many of the functions implemented in **esqlabsR** return an *instance* (or an *object*) of a *class*. These objects can be used as inputs for another methods. Additionally, each object offers a set of properties (which can be another objects) and methods, accessible by the `$` sign:

```r
object1 <- ClassName$new()
aProperty <- object1$property1
resultOfAFunction <- object1$multiply(1,2)
```

Important information about the object can be printed out by calling `print(object)`.

The most important classes are:

  : `DataMapping`
    : Organizes objects of type `XYData`, describing their groupings and used for creating figures. See [Creating figures](figure-creation.html) for more information.
  : `Plotable`
  : `XYData`, inherits `Plotable`
    : Organizes any kind of x-y-values data. See [Data handling](data-handling.html) for more information.
  : `XYData`, inherits `XYData`
    : Sub-type of `XYData` with additional meta-data provided in the default OSPS data format
  : `DataConfiguration`
    : Structure containing information for observed data import. See [Data handling](data-handling.html) for more information.
